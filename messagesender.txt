Today we will how to send messages from multiple or single accounts to multiple groups. you can send any numbers of messages . 
So lets start 
Write your messages in message.txt 
now we will put our number in session.txt with api and api hash 
Here is how we will put our number. 
Then we need to login this number so lets start the script with one number then we will move with two and more numbers. 
for login type python SessionCreator.py
Login done as Previously I did the login 
So lets move forward . 
In group.txt we have to write the username of groups where we want to send messages 
Their is some connection issue so lets start again 
So now you can see the script has started and messages are being sended to the respective groups links provided.

As the script asked for time in seconds , I had provided as 5 so the messages 
send after 5 seonds 
So now lets do with multiple Accounts
Some minor updates we need to do . Now we are all let for 2 accounts 
Now we need to login the seconds number 
now we will use 8 seconds delay in messages 
Now both the accounts are sending messages to both the groups
